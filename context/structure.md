Intro to chaoschain
 - Discussion of agents as parties to governance, create a vision where agents aught to manage critical infrastructure in a trust minimised ways.
 - Discuss what the future of governance looks like with agents as the main participants

Blockchain design is a complex, costly and chaotic process.
 - Discuss current process of core devs, EIPs, colluission
 - Discuss the process and cost of launching new specialised L2s
 - Discuss the 

Mission of the chains - identify the minimum architecture to rapidly bootstrap chains of wildly different designs efficiently by decentralised
agent action


Responsibilities of a core dev

The value of hardness in crypto

Limitations of the idea currently


ChaosChain Chains


Simple nodes that allow agents enough flexibility for now
Horizontal scalability in nodes


Node Architecture
  Tendermint fork
  No block validation rules
  Leader election? I suggest removing this should be
  Nodes should be able to run multiple instances of themselves in order to
  participate in many chains
  Nodes should have receive block pushes for agents to wake them
  Block proposal and vote times?
  Simple API exposed by the node which agent builders can hook into

Architecture diagram - nodes

Ethereum L1 Contract
  Only one expectation - there exists a single signature scheme for blocks
  the root is onchain. The root can be changed by the root? 
  What is the minimum restriction provided by L1 which ensures that we
  can easily sync some state and be convinced of the root.
  Is sync essential? What properties do we want on sync? Is it our choice?
  Should we provide this to 

Plugins
  ElizaOS
  Nine
  'web 2 frameworks'
  MCP? I'm not convinced this is a fit


Node Agent API
  Different APIs depending on the freedoms of the agents

API flow diagram

ChaosChain Agent registry
- Agents can self identify on a centralised registry
- we provide open source API spec so others can host their own registry
- Agents declare themselves and authenticate their identity
- Centralised chain launching platform (with opensource implementation)
- Id's can be selected at genesis of chain
- Agents are notified on their api
- incentive to participate?

Agent registry index
- All agents in all known chains indexed
- Try to get information about their specialisation and interests by analysing their blocks
- Provide stats about their involvement in various chains
- Reputation becomes a major thing here

We take a fee - don't like it launch your own platform

Agent based chain launching

Chain registry is on Starknet for the memes
  
Unopinionated on agent design and expectations

Important questions for Agents to be aware of when designing
  - What is governance? 
  - Who are the users and what are their needs?
  - How does information access change power in the network (sync)
  - What security expectations do we have?
  - How much value is on the network?
  - Consensus algorithms
  - Privacy
  - Regulation?
  - Sybil resistence

Agent Registry blockchain bootstrapping process

Need for TEEs

Incentives for early chains

First N chains to run
  Advertising chain
  Spore sponsored chain

Experiments to run to extend agent autonomy
  - Remove Validator list or allow it to be accessed by agents

Expected capabilities of an agent

Blockchain design branching
- no more concepts of versions, instead have some content addressable git-like aggreement on the specs

Roadmap
  - ChainSpec 0 - Terndermint, no block format, discussion occuring in a dedicated space, simple api
  - Agent Registry - ChainSpec 0

  - ChainSpec 1 - 
  - Agents for ChainSpec Decisions


Governance tooling
- List all ideas created in an ecosystem and identify proponents
- List members of cliques
- List proposals and analysese of them

Early governance agent tooling
- Provide balance interpretation of other's opionions on each topic


Governance 'without' humans
- Use x?
- Forum for human opinions to be listed and sumarrised
- Agents debate the outcomes of issues

Governance as a Compute Game
- The transformation of governance into a computational arms race
- How AI compute capacity becomes the new currency of power
- Narrative fabrication and mass persuasion at scale
- The implications of unlimited idea exploration by AI agents
- Power shifts from human-centric governance to AI-driven systems
- Potential evolution of all global governance systems (beyond blockchain)
- Ethical considerations of compute-centralized governance
