The intent of this documentation is to provide an introduction to
some new concepts about how governance in blockchain may evolve. This idea
may lead to a new war for compute.

The intended documentation site is a mix of intoduction, paper, technical documentation and ideation.

It should have intros, it should explain the concepts and ideas. It should have direct reference to concrete implementations we're making and documentation for them. it should explain the concepts used. It should also have a much deeper academic section with analysis in it.
