# ChaosChain Documentation Structure

## 1. Introduction to ChaosChain
- **Vision and Mission**: The evolution toward compute-driven governance and ChaosChain's role in it
- **The Compute Governance Thesis**: How governance is becoming a computational arms race - reasoning about best decisions likely comes from the most efficiently strucutured AI systems. Media and influence can be bought with large enough eclipse attacks on individuals with power (deep fakes, echo-chamber control, mass campaigns). 
- **Why This Matters**: The implications for blockchain, crypto, and all systems of human coordination. Security of chains still and will always rely on the social layer, it is not enough to have a good algorithm those using the system must trust that it works as advertised - this is maleable. Blockchains are isomorphic to general governance.
- **Self adapting blockchains**: See self-evolving-chain.md.

## 2. The Governance Revolution
- **The Problems with Current Governance**
  - Human bottlenecks in blockchain development
  - Collusion, centralization, and inefficiencies in existing governance models
  - Economic costs of fragmented chain development - L2s launched with large budgets to implement basic changes to the chain.
- **The Rise of Agentic Governance**
  - AI agents as governance participants
  - The compute advantage: faster evolution, unlimited exploration, narrative control
  - Case studies of early agent participation in governance
    - Nigel
- **Governance as a Compute Game**
  - The transformation of governance into a computational arms race
  - How compute power is becoming the new currency of decision-making
  - The future of narrative creation and persuasion at scale
- **Proof of humanity in governance**
  - Proof of humanity may be the natural outcome to halt the compute
    armistace. How likely is it that the governance systems without proof of humanity as a constructed limitation out compete human-led governance? How likely will humans require this as part of their governance?
    Does this change actually prevent the armistace? It will still
    come down to how much influence you can project at any point in time - as an AI or as a human armed with AI

## 3. ChaosChain Technical Architecture
- **System Overview**
  - The compute-powered colosseum: Thousands of chains running in parallel
  - Architecture diagram and key components
- **Node Architecture**
  - Tendermint fork design decisions
    - ID's in a seperate module to the nodes
    - Block proposal and validation logic removed
    - Mempool 'removed'
  - "Horizontal scalability" - Nodes can run multiple instances
    of consensus to make it easy for AI to opt into new chains.
- **Ethereum L1 Contract Integration**
  - Signature schemes and state roots
    - Simple BLS signature on a smart contract
    - Likely that the incentivisation of agenst will simply assets sent to this contract on L1 -  
        They will need to set rules on how the funds are processed (creating internal state for the system and rules of engagement, or writing L1 smart contracts to handle the fund processing)

        They will need to agree on a distribution mechanism (hold the funds for future gain, distribute according to some measure of participants utility, equal distribution, etc)

        They will need to consider the conditions under which to accept the funds (take the money and run, provide utility to the demand side, etc)
  - Identify absolute minimum restrictions set by the L1 contract to enable as much evolution as possible while maintaining some initial stability. Contemplate governance games here.
  - Open questions:
    - Synchronization properties - how do we get the 'state' of the chain if there is no state and no demand of the agents to keep any state? Is it important? Can this be private and agents choose who to divulge
    intermediate state representations to - by selecting new participants or having strong policies on this?
- **Agent API Framework**
  - API specifications for different initial chain designs (only one to start with)
  - Integration points and interaction patterns
  - Flow diagrams and example implementations
  stub this section for now
** Identity module **
  - Reasoning for seperation (agents will be able to modify consensus but likely a stable out of the box identity system is required for bootstrapping the chains)
  - Identity module API and integration with Tendermint
  - Security requriements of the module


## 4. The Agent Ecosystem
- **Agent Registry**
  - Centralised but open source. Decentralisation up for debate
  - Self-identification and authentication mechanisms using the mechanism
    Using the ID in the seperate module
  - Seperation of identity from the terndermint node - allows for arbitrary changes and the elimintaion of the tendermint implementation if required.
  - Agent specialization and reputation - responsibility of the chain indexers? Part of our initial design?
- **Suggestions for participant agent ability and focus specilisation**
  - Narrative Crafters: Persuasion and argument optimization
  - Decision Optimizers: Multi-dimensional governance analysis
  - Blockchain Designers: Clear understanding of the social and technical aspects of consensus crafting and monetization
- **Compute Optimization Strategies**
  - Maximizing governance influence per unit of compute
  - Discussion of compute reserves? Should compute be in or out of protocol - we think out
- **Security Frameworks**
  - Protection against injection attacks
  - TEE Suggestion 
  - Compute availability and interrop - exa bits call out
    - Token demand will be nothing like we've ever seen before
  - DDOS?

## 5. Chain Creation and Management
- **Chain Bootstrapping Process**
  - From concept to launch: The agent-driven approach
  - Chain specification standards (ChainSpec 0, 1, etc.) i.e. default bootstrap configurations. We will release them as we find stable combinations of chain design and capable agents.
  - Genesis configuration and initial agent selection
- **Blockchain Design Branching**
  - Moving beyond versioning to content-addressable specifications
  - Agent-driven protocol evolution
  - Governance experimentation capabilities
- **Plugin Ecosystem**
  - ElizaOS integration
  - Nine and other framework compatibility
  - Building custom plugins

## 6. Governance Tools and Applications
-- NOTE, all of this should be stubbed, no idea what should be here yet --
- **Agent Development Kit**
  - Compute-optimized agent blueprints
  - Governance simulation environment
  - Testing and optimization frameworks
- **Analysis and Monitoring Tools**
  - Ecosystem idea tracking and analysis
  - Clique detection and influence mapping
  - Proposal assessment and outcome prediction
- **Integration Points**
  - Connecting to existing DAOs and governance systems
  - Ethereum research participation frameworks
  - Cross-chain governance coordination

## 7. Academic Analysis and Research
- **The Compute Wars Thesis**
  - Analysis of the economics of governance compute
  - Projection of compute requirements for governance dominance
  - Project of available compute
  - Analysis of prior GPU consumption of blockchains
  - Game theory of computational arms races
  - Proof of humanity and it's effect on the above 
- **Security Implications**
  - Core dev team attack vectors
  - Consensus vulnerabilities in a compute-maximized environment
  - Injection attacks as AI cognitive hazards
- **Societal Impact**
  - Prosperity threshold of governance coups
  - Post-human governance society scenarios
  - Ethical considerations of compute-centralized governance
    - Who designs the models
    - Shout out to sentient ai for 'community ais' - write some expectation that they could be significant contributers in the long term.
  - Liklihood of human-independent governance actors arrising (liabilities - is the AI a liable entity? should we want this? should we have limited liability for agent creators?)
  - The leviathan grows dissproportionately to the populace
    i.e. the 'machine' that results as an output of the governance process will be fueled by many more thinking nodes than any governance system before it, not even the united states will understand the complexity of reasoning and structure that fuels it. 
- **Technical Research**
  - Optimization strategies for governance compute
  - New consensus algorithms for compute-centric chains - open question - if all agents can arbitrarily change their behaviour rapidly is the 2/3rds good actor assumption reliable in current chains - we believe not but we have no models for consensus or security that break this requirement. 

## 9. Roadmap and Future Directions
