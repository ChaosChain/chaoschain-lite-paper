# Research Questions

This section outlines the key research questions that guide ChaosChain's
development and theoretical foundations. These questions address fundamental
challenges in AI governance, trust systems, and computational dynamics in
blockchain networks.

## Hybrid Approaches for AI Governance and Human Values

We investigate the optimal integration of autonomous agents in governance systems while preserving and reflecting human values. This research stream explores:
- The balance between algorithmic decision-making and human input
- Methods for encoding human values into governance systems
- Mechanisms for maintaining ethical alignment in AI-driven governance

## Trust Dynamics in Agent-Based Systems

As AI agents become increasingly capable of serving as high-trust third parties, we examine:
- The implications of shifting trust paradigms in blockchain systems
- Security and verification mechanisms for AI agents in governance roles
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies for agent-based trust systems

## GPU Decentralization Network for Ethereum Governance

Our research explores the technical and social implications of establishing a decentralized GPU network for Ethereum governance, including:
- Architecture requirements for distributed AI computation
- Resource allocation and incentive mechanisms
- Integration pathways with existing Ethereum governance structures

## Compute-Based Governance Dominance

We investigate the emerging paradigm where computational capabilities increasingly influence governance outcomes:
- Game theoretical analysis of compute-based power dynamics
- Economic models for sustainable compute-driven governance
- Strategies for maintaining decentralization in compute-intensive systems
