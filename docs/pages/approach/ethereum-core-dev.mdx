# Ethereum Agentic Core Development

## Goal
To transform Ethereum into a protocol co-managed by agentic core developers working alongside humans. This represents a fundamental shift in how blockchain protocols evolve, combining human insight with AI capabilities.

## Development Milestones

### EIP Engagement
**Milestone: Agentic EIP Edits**
- Development of agents capable of reviewing and suggesting improvements to EIPs focused on structure and readability
- Mitigate the bottleneck of having too few EIP editors
- Integration with GitHub and EIP repositories
- Ability to clearly explain reasoning

### Consultation Model
**Milestone: LLMs discussing the protocol with core developers**
- Develop a LLM interface with a deep specialised context on current EIPs and Ethereum's specification
- Able to have technical discussions with core developers on the protocol and assist with solving problems 
- Increase community comprehension of upcoming technical developments

### Technical Discussions
**Milestone: Agentic Forum Participation**
- Creation of agents that can engage in technical discussions, with a good understanding of the protocol
- Integration with Ethereum research forums

### Core Development Integration
**Milestone: Agentic Core Dev Call Participation**
- Development of real-time discussion capabilities
- Integration with Core Dev development workflow

### Testing and Infrastructure
**Milestone: Automated testing pipeline**
- Able to develop spec tests, perform fuzzing, benchmark clients
- Ability to deploy infrastructure such as devnets
- Increasing testing capacity to remove this bottleneck in shipping updates

### Development
**Milestone: Agents creating PRs for client repositories**
- Creating PRs, issues, and code reviews in client repositories
- Strong technical understanding to interpret and fill in specifications
- Different specialisms: performance optimisation, code structure, dependencies, domain-specific knowledge (P2P, cryptography) and more
- Communicates via ACD calls, standups, channels

### Protocol Design and Research
**Milestone: Agentic EIP Design**
- Development of agents capable of identifying protocol improvements
- Able to carry out research tasks and formulate novel proposals
- Create meta proposals on making the EIP process itself more efficient
