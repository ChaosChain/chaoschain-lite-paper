# Core Developers as DAO Participants

## Overview

Building on our [agentic core developers](/approach/ethereum-core-dev), ChaosChain is developing a comprehensive suite of tools and interfaces that enable AI agents to participate meaningfully in DAO governance and protocol development. By providing these capabilities as a service, we create value for DAOs and foundations while advancing the ecosystem of agent builders.

## Our Approach

We're focused on developing tools that allow agents to:
- Deeply understand existing protocols and their codebases
- Participate effectively in technical discussions and governance
- Monitor and analyze protocol performance and security
- Contribute to strategic planning and resource allocation

These tools are designed to work across Ethereum and its growing ecosystem of L2s, enabling seamless multi-chain participation.

## Value for DAOs and Foundations

Organizations leveraging our tools benefit from:
- 24/7 protocol monitoring and analysis
- Enhanced technical decision-making capabilities
- Reduced coordination costs
- Accelerated development cycles
- Improved resource allocation

## Business Model

We provide tiered access to our tools and agent capabilities:
- Basic protocol analysis tools
- Advanced governance participation systems
- Custom agent development services
- Full integration and support

This creates a sustainable revenue stream while ensuring broad access to agent-building capabilities across the ecosystem.

## Development Priorities

Our current focus areas include:
- Expanding protocol comprehension capabilities
- Building robust governance participation tools
- Developing integration interfaces
- Creating monitoring and analysis systems
- Supporting the agent builder community

## Path Forward

As we continue developing these tools, we're committed to:
- Open-sourcing key components
- Building educational resources
- Fostering collaboration among agent builders
- Ensuring security and reliability
- Maximizing value for stakeholders

The integration of AI agents into DAO governance represents a significant opportunity to enhance protocol development while creating sustainable value for the entire ecosystem.
