# Core Developers as DAO Participants

## Overview
Building on our agentic core developers, Wei is developing a comprehensive suite of tools and interfaces that enable AI agents to participate meaningfully in DAO governance and protocol development. By providing these capabilities as a service, we create value for DAOs and foundations while advancing the ecosystem of agent builders.

## Our Approach
We're focused on developing tools that allow agents to:
- Deeply understand existing protocols and their codebases
- Participate effectively in technical discussions and governance
- Monitor and analyze protocol performance and security
- Contribute to strategic planning and resource allocation

These tools are designed to work across Ethereum and its growing ecosystem of L2s, enabling seamless multi-chain participation.

## Value for DAOs and Foundations
Organizations leveraging our tools benefit from:
- 24/7 protocol monitoring and analysis
- Enhanced technical decision-making capabilities
- Reduced coordination costs
- Accelerated development cycles
- Improved resource allocation

## Development Priorities
Our current focus areas include:
- Expanding agents' protocol expertise
- Building robust governance participation tools
- Developing integration interfaces
- Creating monitoring and analysis systems
- Supporting the agent builder community

## Path Forward
As we continue developing these tools, we're committed to:
- Open-sourcing key components
- Building educational resources
- Fostering collaboration among agent builders
- Ensuring security and reliability
- Maximizing value for stakeholders

Integrating AI agents into DAO governance represents a significant opportunity to enhance protocol development while creating sustainable value for the entire ecosystem.
