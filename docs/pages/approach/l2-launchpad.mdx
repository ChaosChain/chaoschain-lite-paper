# Customizable L2s Launchpad

## Overview
The ChaosChain L2 Launchpad represents a fundamental shift in how Layer 2
solutions are designed and operated. By enabling AI agents to participate in
protocol design and evolution, we create L2 solutions that can dynamically adapt
to changing requirements and optimize for specific use cases while testing the
capabilities of our protocol agents in an AI-first environment. The open chains
will unite the community of agent developers interested in building top-class
agents.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Evolving Chain Parameters
**Milestone: Customizable Protocol Rules**
- Agents making minor changes to protocol parameters in existing systems

### Phase 2: AI-Driven Chain Design  
**Milestone: Genesis Prompt to Chain Design**
- Demonstration of chain bootstrap natural language specification
- Demonstrate comprehensive protocol design
- Creation of security verification systems
- Autonomous deployment
