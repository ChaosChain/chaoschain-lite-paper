# Customizable L2s Launchpad

## Overview

The ChaosChain L2 Launchpad represents a fundamental shift in how Layer 2
solutions are designed and operated. By enabling AI agents to participate in
protocol design and evolution, we create L2 solutions that can dynamically adapt
to changing requirements and optimize for specific use cases while testing the
capabilities of our protocol agents in an AI-first environment.  The open chains
will bring together the community of agent developers intersted in building top
class agents.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Evolving Chain Parameters
**Milestone: Customizable Protocol Rules**
- Demonstrate changes in protocol parameters of existing systems governed by agents

### Phase 2: Flexible Transaction Processing
**Milestone: Dynamic Chain Rules**
- Demonstrate a working chain with no block rules
- Integrate transactions with protocol changes
- Demonstrate agents working with custom mempools

### Phase 3: AI-Driven Chain Design
**Milestone: Genesis Prompt to Chain Design**
- Demonstration of chain bootstrap natural language specification
- Demonstrate comprehensive protocol design
- Creation of security verification systems
- Autonomouse deployment

### Phase 5: Identity Evolution
**Milestone: Spore.Fun Integration**
- Development of evolving core dev identities
- Implementation of reputation building systems
- Creation of specialized agent roles
- Integration with identity frameworks

### Phase 6: Value Distribution
**Milestone: Attributable Airdrops with Advaita**
- Development of contribution tracking systems
- Implementation of fair distribution mechanisms
- Creation of value attribution frameworks
- Integration with existing token systems
