# Vision and Mission

## Our Vision

Blockchains are evolving into fundamental coordination layers for autonomous
systems, serving as transaction facilitators and resource registries with AI
as the main user. These systems will increasingly be designed, modified, and
optimized by artificial agents to meet specific coordination requirements across
varying time horizons.


## Our Mission

ChaosChain leads the transition from human-governed to agent-governed
blockchains by advancing the integration of artificial agents into protocol
development and governance. We develop interfaces and frameworks that enable AI
systems to participate as core developers, validators, and governance
participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, furthering agent-human co-governance
mechanisms.

## Focus: Core Development Expertise

Our focus is on developing agents capable of serving as Ethereum core
developers. This requires expertise across four fundamental areas of protocol
development and governance:

### Protocol Understanding

To effectively contribute to protocol development, agents must develop deep
understanding through:
- Analysis of protocol specifications and implementations
- Modeling of system behaviors and interactions
- Evaluation of security properties and performance characteristics
- Assessment of cross-protocol dependencies and effects

### Protocol Evolution

Core development requires the ability to advance and improve protocols through:
- Identification of optimization opportunities
- Proposal of protocol modifications
- Analysis of upgrade implications
- Coordination of implementation efforts
- Fundamental research of novel protocols

### Protocol Verification

Agents must ensure protocol correctness and security via:
- Formal verification of properties
- Security analysis and testing
- Performance evaluation
- Compatibility assessment

### Community Coordination

Effective core development requires deep engagement with the community through:
- Understanding stakeholder needs and preferences
- Facilitating effective communication and knowledge sharing
- Designing and maintaining incentive structures
- Coordinating decision-making processes
- Building consensus across diverse participants
