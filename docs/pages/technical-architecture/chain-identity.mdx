# Chain Identity System

## Overview

The ChaosChain identity system provides a secure, verifiable mechanism for chain identification and registration. Each chain is uniquely identified through multiple representations that are cryptographically linked to the chain's genesis block.

This system enables nodes to participate in multiple chains simultaneously while maintaining clear separation between chain instances and ensuring that transactions and operations are directed to the intended chain.

## Chain Identifier Format

Each ChaosChain has three forms of identification:

1. **Human-Readable Identifier** (String Format):
   ```
   cc-[namespace]-[chain-id]-[network]:g[genesis-short]
   ```
   
   Components:
   - `cc-`: Fixed prefix indicating a ChaosChain network
   - `[namespace]`: Organizational or purpose-based grouping (e.g., "finance", "research")
   - `[chain-id]`: Unique name for the specific chain
   - `[network]`: Optional network type (e.g., "mainnet", "testnet")
   - `:g[genesis-short]`: Abbreviated genesis block hash (first 6 characters) for verification

   Examples:
   - `cc-finance-derivatives-mainnet:g7a1e9f`
   - `cc-research-quantum-testnet:g3b8c2d`

2. **EVM-Compatible Identifier** (Integer Format):
   - A unique integer compatible with EVM chain ID conventions
   - ChaosChain reserves the range from 6,660,000 to 6,669,999
   - Used for transaction signing and EVM compatibility

3. **Genesis Block Hash** (Cryptographic Identifier):
   - SHA-256 hash of the chain's genesis block
   - Serves as the immutable cryptographic identifier
   - Used for definitive chain verification

## Chain Registration

For detailed information about the chain registration process, please refer to the [Chain Creation](/chain-management/creation) documentation.

## Chain Identity Verification

Participants can verify a chain's identity through several mechanisms:

1. **Genesis Hash Verification**
   - Compare the locally computed genesis block hash with the registered hash
   - This provides cryptographic certainty about chain identity

2. **L1 Contract Query**
   - Query the L1 contract directly using any of the three identifiers
   - Verify that all identifiers match the expected values

3. **Registry API Query**
   - Query the Agent Registry API for chain details:
     ```
     GET /api/v1/chains/{chainId}
     ```
   - Verify the chain's registration details and current status

4. **Chains API Query**
   - Query the Chains API for comprehensive chain details:
     ```
     GET /api/v1/chains/{chainId}
     ```
   - Retrieve detailed chain information including identifiers, status, registration, and statistics
   - This endpoint accepts either the human-readable chain ID or EVM chain ID as the identifier
   - The response includes all three forms of chain identification for cross-verification
