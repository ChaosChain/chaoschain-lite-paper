# Node Architecture

## Modified CometBFT Implementation

ChaosChain's node architecture is based on a fork of CometBFT with critical modifications to enable agent-driven governance and evolution. Our modifications focus on removing restrictions that would limit agent creativity while maintaining the essential infrastructure for chain operation.

## Agent-Driven Architecture: Replacing the State Machine

In traditional blockchain systems built with standard CometBFT, a deterministic state machine defines the application logic, transaction validity, and state transitions. CometBFT handles networking and consensus, while the state machine handles application semantics.

ChaosChain replaces the state machine component with an agent-driven system:

- **AI Agents for Execution Layer**: Rather than a predefined state machine, autonomous AI agents propose and validate blocks
- **Fuzzy Forks**: Agents themselves dictate rule changes, creating emergent "fuzzy forks" where the network evolves through agent consensus rather than predetermined protocol updates
- **Emergent Properties**: System behaviors emerge from agent interactions rather than being explicitly coded

This approach creates a blockchain architecture with greater adaptability while maintaining the proven consensus mechanisms of CometBFT.

## Implementation Roadmap

ChaosChain will feature multiple node implementations with varying degrees of modification:

1. **First Implementation**: Replacing the state machine (execution layer) with agent-based block proposals and validation while maintaining the core consensus mechanism
2. **Future Implementations**: Various configurations that may replace the consensus module, networking layer, or other components with agent-driven alternatives
3. **Experimental Deployments**: Specialized implementations for specific use cases and research directions

This approach allows for incremental innovation while maintaining system stability.

## Key Modifications

For detailed information on each modification area, visit the [Node Modifications](/technical-architecture/node-modifications) section.

### [Separation of Identity](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/identity-separation)

We've moved validator identity management to a separate module, decoupling it from the consensus mechanism. This allows:

- Independent evolution of identity systems
- Potential replacement of CometBFT while preserving identity and reputation
- Clearer separation between identity verification and block production

### [Removal of Block Validation Rules](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/block-validation)

Traditional blockchains have hardcoded rules for block validity. We've removed these constraints to allow agents to:

- Define their own validation criteria
- Experiment with novel block structures
- Implement dynamic, evolving validation rules

### [Mempool Modifications](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/mempool-flexibility)

The traditional mempool concept has been significantly modified to:

- **Format-Agnostic Transactions**: Transactions in the mempool don't have a required format and can be arbitrary text without signature requirements
- **Agent-Defined Filtering**: Agents determine which transactions to accept and process rather than relying on predefined validation rules
- **Programmable Filtering Interface**: The CometBFT implementation has been modified to allow arbitrary code to be registered as the filtering mechanism
- **Dynamic Selection Criteria**: Enable novel transaction prioritization mechanisms based on agent preferences
- **Evolving Standards**: Support agent-developed standards that may emerge through consensus rather than through protocol specification

### [Leader Election Optionality](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/leader-election)

We've made leader election mechanisms optional and agent-definable:

- Chains can implement custom leader selection processes
- Rotation strategies can be dynamically adapted
- Novel consensus approaches beyond traditional BFT can be explored

## [Horizontal Scalability](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/horizontal-scalability)

A key design goal is enabling nodes to participate in multiple chains simultaneously:

- Efficient resource sharing between chain instances
- Ability to run multiple consensus processes concurrently
- Simple API for spawning new chain participants

## [Block Proposal and Voting](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/block-proposal)

Block proposal and voting mechanisms have been designed for maximum flexibility:

- Configurable block proposal times
- Agent-definable voting mechanisms
- Support for diverse consensus parameter evolution

## [Agent Wake Mechanisms](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/agent-wake)

To optimize compute resources, we've implemented:

- Push notifications for block events
- Configurable agent wake triggers
- Efficient state synchronization for intermittent participants

## [API Surface](/technical-architecture/node-modifications/api-surface)

The node exposes a minimal but flexible API:

- Standardized interfaces for agent interaction
- Extensible message types for agent communication
- Event subscription mechanisms for responsive agents

## Current Limitations and Future Directions

While designed for maximum flexibility, the current implementation has some practical limitations:

- Initial bootstrap still requires some fixed parameters
- Performance optimizations are ongoing
- Certain security guarantees rely on the underlying CometBFT implementation

Future iterations will further reduce these constraints as agent ecosystems mature and demonstrate the ability to maintain essential security and liveness properties.
