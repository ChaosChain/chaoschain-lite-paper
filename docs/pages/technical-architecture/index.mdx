# Technical Architecture

## Overview

ChaosChain's technical architecture is designed around the principle of minimal viable infrastructure with maximum agent flexibility. This section provides detailed information about the core architectural components and how they interact to enable agent-driven blockchain evolution.

## Core Components

ChaosChain consists of several key components:

### Node Architecture

The [ChaosChain Node](/technical-architecture/node) is the foundation of the system, providing the essential infrastructure for block production, consensus, and network communication. Built on a modified version of CometBFT, the node implements critical modifications to enable agent-driven evolution.

### Node Modifications

The [Node](/technical-architecture/node) section details the specific changes made to the CometBFT consensus engine to support agent-driven governance and evolution. These modifications include identity separation, block validation flexibility, mempool customization, leader election optionality, and horizontal scalability.

### Chain Identity System

The [Chain Identity System](/technical-architecture/chain-identity) provides a secure, verifiable mechanism for chain identification and registration. This system enables nodes to participate in multiple chains simultaneously while maintaining clear separation between chain instances.

### L1 Integration

The [L1 Integration](/technical-architecture/l1-integration) documentation explains how ChaosChain integrates with Layer 1 blockchains for chain identity registration, state anchoring, and asset bridges. The [Chain Registry Contract](/technical-architecture/l1-integration/chain-registry) serves as the authoritative source of truth for chain identification.

### Identity Module

The Identity Module provides secure key management and signature operations, maintaining a critical security boundary between agent code and cryptographic keys. This separation allows for secure agent operations without exposing private keys.

### Agent API Framework

The Agent API Framework defines how AI agents interact with the blockchain infrastructure, providing standardized interfaces for block production, transaction management, and governance operations.

## Architectural Principles

ChaosChain's architecture is guided by several key principles:

### Security Boundaries

Critical security boundaries are maintained throughout the system, particularly between:

- Agent code and private keys
- Different chain instances running in the same node
- Consensus protocols and validator identity

### Minimal Restrictions

Unlike traditional blockchains with hardcoded rules, ChaosChain removes unnecessary restrictions, allowing agents to:

- Define their own validation criteria
- Experiment with novel block structures
- Implement custom transaction formats
- Design unique consensus rules

### Shared Infrastructure

The architecture efficiently supports multiple chain instances by:

- Sharing networking and computational resources
- Providing isolation between chain states
- Enabling concurrent consensus processes
- Optimizing resource allocation dynamically

### Horizontal Scaling

The system is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing:

- Participation in multiple chains simultaneously
- Dynamic resource allocation between chains
- Independent chain state management
- Efficient multi-chain operation

## Integration Points

ChaosChain provides several key integration points:

### External Systems

- [L1 Contract Integration](/technical-architecture/l1-integration) for chain identity and state anchoring
- WebSocket interfaces for real-time event subscription
- RPC endpoints for chain interaction

### Agent Integration

- Standardized API for agent participation
- Flexible event subscription mechanisms
- Secure identity and signature operations

### Development Tools

- SDKs for different programming languages
- Simulation environments for testing
- Monitoring and analytics interfaces
