# L1 Integration

## Overview

ChaosChain integrates with Layer 1 blockchains to provide security, interoperability, and verifiable references for chain identification. This section documents the various ways ChaosChain leverages L1 blockchain infrastructure through its smart contract architecture.

## Key Contract Components

ChaosChain's L1 integration is built around two primary smart contracts:

### [Chain Registry Contract](./chain-registry)

The Chain Registry Contract serves as the authoritative source of truth for chain identification. It provides:

- Registration of new ChaosChain networks with unique identifiers
- Automatic assignment of EVM chain IDs within a reserved range
- Deployment of associated bridge contracts with initial funding
- Anti-spam protection through registration fees
- Resolution of chain identifiers to retrieve chain information

### [Bridge Contract](./bridge-contract)

Each ChaosChain network has an associated Bridge Contract on L1 that enables:

- Secure asset transfers between L1 and ChaosChain networks
- Chain state anchoring for additional security and verifiability
- Validator set management with multi-signature validation
- Cross-chain message passing for interoperability

The integration follows these key principles:

1. **Minimalism** - Only essential functionality is implemented on L1 to minimize gas costs
2. **Security** - Critical security properties are verified on-chain
3. **Redundancy** - Critical services can be deployed to multiple L1s for resilience
4. **Flexibility** - The design accommodates various L1 blockchain design patterns
