# L1 Integration

## Overview

ChaosChain integrates with Layer 1 blockchains to provide security, interoperability, and verifiable references for chain identification. This section documents the various ways ChaosChain leverages L1 blockchain infrastructure.

## Key Integration Areas

### Chain Registry

The [Chain Registry Contract](/technical-architecture/l1-integration/registry-contract) serves as the authoritative source of truth for chain identification. It maps between human-readable chain identifiers, EVM-compatible chain IDs, and genesis block hashes.

### State Anchoring

ChaosChain chains can optionally anchor their state to L1 blockchains, providing additional security and verifiability. This creates cryptographic proof that a particular chain state existed at a specific point in time.

### Asset Bridges

ChaosChain supports standardized bridge mechanisms for transferring assets between L1 blockchains and ChaosChain instances. These bridges facilitate liquidity movement and cross-chain operations.

## Supported L1 Blockchains

ChaosChain is designed to integrate with multiple L1 blockchains:

1. **Ethereum** - Primary integration for the Chain Registry Contract
2. **Other EVM-Compatible L1s** - Secondary support for chain registries and state anchoring
3. **Future Integrations** - The design allows for additional L1 integrations as needed

## Implementation Principles

The L1 integration follows these key principles:

1. **Minimalism** - Only essential functionality is implemented on L1 to minimize gas costs
2. **Security** - Critical security properties are verified on-chain
3. **Redundancy** - Critical services can be deployed to multiple L1s for resilience
4. **Flexibility** - The design accommodates various L1 blockchain design patterns
