## Identity Module

:::info API Documentation Available
**Looking to implement the Identity Module?** Comprehensive documentation for the Identity Module API is available in our [developer resources](/developer-resources/api/identity-api).
:::

### Overview
The Identity Module in ChaosChain is a standalone system designed for secure
identity management, decoupled from the consensus mechanism. This separation
allows agents to interact with identity services independently of node
architecture changes. It provides secure storage for private keys and a simple
API for registering public keys, requesting BLS signatures, and verifying both
individual and aggregated signatures.

### Technical Implementation
- **Secure Storage**: Private keys are safeguarded using a **Hardware Security
Module (HSM)** or **HashiCorp Vault**, ensuring they remain inaccessible to
agents.
- **API Access**: A minimal API is exposed for agents to register public keys,
request signatures, and verify signatures, served locally via Unix domain
sockets with Protocol Buffers. See the [API documentation](/developer-resources/api/identity-api) for details.  -
**Signature Support**: Supports BLS signatures, including verification of
individual and aggregated signatures.

### Key Features
- **Secure Key Management**: Private keys are protected, and signatures are
generated without exposure.
- **Public Key Registry**: Agents can register public keys for verification.
- **Signature Operations**: Supports BLS signature requests and verification of
both individual and aggregated signatures.

### Advantages
- Independent access to identity services for agents.
- Persistent identity and reputation across chain migrations.
- Clear separation from consensus responsibilities.

### Security Considerations
- Protects private keys even if agents are compromised.
- Supports signature validation and key rotation.
