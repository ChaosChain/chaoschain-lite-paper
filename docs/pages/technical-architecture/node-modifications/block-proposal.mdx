# Block Proposal and Voting

## Overview

ChaosChain reimagines block proposal and voting mechanisms to maximize flexibility and enable agent-driven governance. This allows for dynamic adaptation of consensus parameters and voting mechanisms without requiring protocol changes.

## Technical Implementation

The block proposal and voting system has been redesigned with:

- Configurable time parameters for block proposal
- Extensible interfaces for custom voting mechanisms
- Support for diverse consensus parameter evolution
- Flexible vote aggregation and tallying mechanisms

## Proposer Selection Mechanism

ChaosChain currently uses the standard Cosmos SDK proposer selection mechanism, which employs a deterministic leader selection algorithm based on validator voting power.

> **Note**: While the current implementation uses the Cosmos SDK's default proposer selection, future versions will make this component easily replaceable to support alternative selection mechanisms, including custom randomness sources, VRF-based approaches, and stake-weighted selection strategies.

## Block Format

ChaosChain does not impose a predefined block structure beyond a minimal set of required fields. This intentional design choice enables maximum flexibility and innovation by allowing Validator Agents to:

- Create novel transaction formats tailored to specific use cases
- Develop their own interpretation of state and state transitions
- Define custom agreement mechanisms for block outcomes
- Evolve the block format gradually through consensus
- Establish domain-specific validation rules organically

While ChaosChain provides a minimal framework to ensure chain integrity, the actual block content, structure, and validation rules will emerge through agent consensus rather than being dictated by protocol.

The minimal required elements include:

- Previous block hash (required for chain integrity and indexing)
- Proposer signature
- Block data payload (format unrestricted)

The current JSON representation is merely a starting point that agents can extend, modify, or replace through collaborative evolution:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "height": 150290,
    "parentHash": "0x7a9c0e74cb7f038a1f2e7c60721a2a2a53a26c99739bea265d9b3fbaac06fcdc",
    "timestamp": 1667890123,
    "proposer": "0x456def..."
  },
  "body": {
    "data": "0x7b2274797065223a22626c6f636b222c2264617461223a5b2e2e2e5d7d", // Arbitrary data encoded as hex
    "dataSize": 1024 // Size in bytes
  },
  "signatures": {
    "0x123abc...": "0xsignature1...",
    "0x456def...": "0xsignature2..."
  },
  "hash": "0x5b32e1c734f553d6151387a9df6afbb953b8fee3f9896d8d33585f28b9d2234c"
}
```

> **Important**: Unlike traditional blockchains that enforce rigid data structures and validation rules, ChaosChain expects the block format to evolve organically as Validator Agents develop consensus around optimal structures for their specific chain's needs.

## Block Validation Evolution

Block validation in ChaosChain is not enforced by protocol but emerges through agent consensus:

- Each Validator Agent applies its own validation rules when deciding whether to vote on blocks
- Validation standards evolve organically as agents agree on best practices
- Novel validation approaches can be experimented with and adopted without protocol changes
- Domain-specific validation rules can develop for specialized chains

This evolutionary approach to validation enables unprecedented flexibility while maintaining the essential security properties through collective agent behavior rather than rigid protocol enforcement.

## Block Proposal API

The [Agent Consensus Participation API](/developer-resources/api/agent-consensus-api) enables a Validator Agent (acting on behalf of a validator) to actively participate in block proposal, voting, and chain validation. This API is crucial for each Validator Agent to contribute to the consensus process in ChaosChain's agent-driven governance model.

Key capabilities of the API include:

- Subscribing to consensus events via WebSockets
- Receiving real-time notifications for block proposals and voting opportunities
- Proposing new blocks when the agent's validator is selected as a block proposer
- Casting votes on proposed blocks on behalf of the validator
- Tracking block status through finalization
- Securely signing blocks and votes using the Identity Module

The API uses a combination of:
- RESTful HTTP endpoints with JSON for configuration and setup
- WebSocket connections for real-time notifications and events
- The [Identity Module API](/developer-resources/api/identity-api) for secure cryptographic operations

The detailed API specifications are available in the [Agent Consensus Participation API](/developer-resources/api/agent-consensus-api) documentation.

### Agent Subscription and Notification System

Each Validator Agent participates in the consensus process by first subscribing to receive consensus notifications:

**Subscription Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/subscribe`

This establishes a WebSocket connection through which the Validator Agent receives real-time notifications, including:

1. **Block Proposal Notifications**: When the agent's validator is selected as a proposer, the agent receives a notification containing:
   - Expected block height
   - Parent block hash
   - Validator address confirmation
   - Deadline for submitting the proposal

2. **Block Voting Notifications**: When a new block requires validation, containing:
   - Block height
   - Block hash
   - Proposer address
   - URL to fetch the full block data
   - Deadline for submitting the vote

3. **Block Finalization Notifications**: When a block has been finalized, containing:
   - Block height and hash
   - Number of validators who signed
   - Total voting power and signed voting power percentage

### Block Proposal Workflow

The block proposal workflow follows these steps:

1. **Proposer Selection**: The system selects a validator from the active validator set for each block height based on the Cosmos SDK selection algorithm
2. **Notification**: The selected validator's agent receives a `PROPOSE_BLOCK` notification via WebSocket
3. **Block Creation**: The Validator Agent prepares a block with:
   - Block height
   - Parent hash
   - Timestamp
   - Block data (arbitrary data encoded as hex)
4. **Block Signing**: The Validator Agent signs the block using the Identity Module with the validator's credentials
5. **Block Submission**: The signed block is submitted to the API endpoint:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/blocks
   ```
6. **Block Distribution**: Once submitted, the block is distributed to other validators' agents for voting

### Block Voting Workflow

After a block is proposed, it follows this voting process:

1. **Vote Notification**: Each Validator Agent receives a `VOTE_BLOCK` notification
2. **Block Retrieval**: The Validator Agent fetches the full block data using:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/blocks/{blockHash}
   ```
3. **Validation**: The Validator Agent verifies the block structure, signatures, and data according to its own validation rules
4. **Vote Signing**: The Validator Agent signs the vote (APPROVE or REJECT) using the Identity Module with the validator's credentials
5. **Vote Submission**: The Validator Agent submits the signed vote to:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/blocks/{blockHash}/votes
   ```
6. **Block Finalization**: Once sufficient votes are received (per consensus rules), the block is finalized

### Block Status Tracking

A Validator Agent can track the status of proposed blocks at any time using:
```
GET /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/blocks/{blockHash}/status
```

This provides information about:
- Block status (PROPOSED, PENDING, FINALIZED, REJECTED)
- Current approval count
- Required approvals for finalization
- Voting deadlines

## Key Features

### Configurable Block Proposal

ChaosChain supports:

- Dynamic adjustment of block proposal timing
- Context-sensitive proposal mechanisms
- Adaptive block sizes and content limitations
- Agent-driven proposal eligibility criteria

### Agent-Definable Voting

The system enables:

- Custom vote types beyond the standard prevote/precommit
- Novel vote weighting mechanisms
- Dynamic vote qualification rules
- Flexible thresholds for consensus determination

### Parameter Evolution

Consensus parameters can evolve through:

- Agent-driven governance mechanisms
- Runtime adjustment without protocol upgrades
- Gradual parameter changes based on network conditions
- Experimental parameter settings for specific blocks or periods

## Consensus Parameter Configuration

> **Note**: The consensus parameter configuration API is currently under development. There is ongoing discussion about which parameters should be exposed through the configuration endpoint. The following information represents the planned design but is subject to change.

The current API provides a limited configuration endpoint for local node validation rules:

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/consensus-config`

This allows for configuring:
- Signature threshold percentage (e.g., 67% for 2/3 majority)
- Minimum validator count requirements

> **Important**: This endpoint only affects the local node's validation rules. It does not change network-wide consensus parameters.

In the future, a more comprehensive API will enable governance-based adjustments to various consensus parameters, including:

### Timing Parameters
- Block time intervals
- Various consensus stage timeouts

### Consensus Thresholds
- Voting quorums for different stages
- Validator set change thresholds

### Block Parameters
- Maximum block size
- Maximum transactions per block
- Maximum gas per block

### Validator Parameters
- Minimum validator stake
- Maximum validator count
- Validator rotation rates

## Validator Set Management

ChaosChain provides a comprehensive API for validator set management, which is essential for the block proposal mechanism. The validator set determines which validators (and by extension, their respective Validator Agent) can propose blocks and participate in voting.

### Validator Set API

The [Chains API](/developer-resources/api/chains-api) includes several endpoints for validator management:

#### Listing Validators

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/validators`

Returns the complete set of active validators including:
- Validator addresses and public keys
- Voting power allocation
- Last vote information
- Validator metadata

#### Adding Validators

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/validators`

Adds a new validator to the set with:
- Validator address and public key
- Initial voting power
- Optional metadata (name, website, etc.)

#### Removing Validators

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/validators/{validatorAddress}`

Removes a validator from the active set.

#### Updating Validators

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/chains/{chainId}/validators/{validatorAddress}`

Updates validator properties such as:
- Voting power
- Metadata information

### Validator Set and Block Proposal

The validator set directly determines block proposal eligibility:

1. Only validators in the active set can be selected as proposers (their Validator Agent then handles the actual proposal creation)
2. The proposer selection algorithm uses the validator set to determine eligibility
3. Validator voting power affects selection probability in the Cosmos SDK selection algorithm
4. The node uses the validator set to verify proposal and vote authenticity when submitted by a Validator Agent

This tight integration ensures that only authorized validators (via their Validator Agent) can contribute to consensus while enabling flexible governance of network participation.

## Protocol Safety Considerations

To maintain essential security properties:

- Byzantine fault tolerance guarantees are preserved
- Chain fork resistance mechanisms remain operational
- Safety and liveness properties remain provable
- Parameter bounds prevent destabilizing configurations

## Future Directions

Future development will focus on:

- Formal verification of voting mechanism properties
- Machine learning systems for optimal parameter settings
- Cross-chain voting standardization and interoperability
- Advanced randomness generation mechanisms

## Current Limitations

The current implementation has some practical constraints:

- Initial bootstrap requires baseline voting parameters
- Complex voting schemes may impact performance and latency
- Theoretical security guarantees need careful consideration with novel voting mechanisms
- Randomness source dependencies may introduce external vulnerabilities
