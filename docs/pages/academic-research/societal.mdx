## Overview

The shift toward compute-driven governance has profound societal implications. This research explores the social, ethical, and political dimensions of computational governance systems and their potential impact on human society.

## Key Research Areas

- The prosperity threshold of governance coups and access equality
- Post-human governance society scenarios
- Ethical considerations of compute-centralized governance
- Implications for democratic systems and human autonomy

## Research Approach

Our analysis incorporates perspectives from political science, philosophy, sociology, and economics to provide a comprehensive understanding of how compute-driven governance may reshape social structures.
