# Compute Wars Thesis

> **Warning:** This research section is currently in progress and under active development.

## Overview

The Compute Wars Thesis examines the fundamental premise that governance is evolving into a computational arms race. This research explores the economics, game theory, and technical requirements of governance in a compute-maximized environment.

## Key Research Areas

- Economics of governance compute investments and returns
- Game-theoretic models of computational arms races
- Projections of computational requirements for governance
- Available compute estimates and global distribution
- **Potential limiting factors including proof of humanity mechanisms**

## Human Element in Computational Governance

> **Active Research:** We are currently investigating whether proof of humanity mechanisms (e.g., one-person-one-vote systems) can meaningfully impact computational governance dynamics.

While our primary research focuses on compute-maximized governance, we recognize the importance of exploring potential counterbalances:

- How would verified human participation rights alter the economics of governance compute?
- Can human-specific governance domains create meaningful resistance to computational capture?
- What hybrid models might emerge that combine human judgment with computational optimization?

### Persistent Compute Advantages

Our research indicates that even with proof of humanity mechanisms in place, compute capture will still emerge through two primary vectors:

1. **Individual-level compute asymmetry**: Even in systems with one-person-one-vote mechanisms, individuals with superior computational resources maintain significant advantages in:
   - Strategic decision optimization
   - Outcome simulation and planning
   - Persuasive capacity toward other governance participants
   - Information processing and analysis

2. **Competitive pressure from unrestricted systems**: Governance systems without proof of humanity restrictions will likely demonstrate superior performance in certain metrics, creating evolutionary pressure on human-centric systems to reduce or eliminate such restrictions.

These dynamics suggest that proof of humanity mechanisms, while potentially creating some constraints on compute capture, are unlikely to fundamentally alter the trajectory toward compute-driven governance.

This intersection of human-centered mechanisms with computational governance remains an open question with significant implications for the Compute Wars Thesis. For more details, see our [Proof of Humanity](/governance-revolution/proof-of-humanity) research.

## Research Methodology

Our research combines quantitative modeling, empirical analysis, and theoretical frameworks from economics and computer science.
