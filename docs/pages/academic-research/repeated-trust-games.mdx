# Repeated Trust Games

> **Warning:** This research section is currently under construction and active development.

## Overview

This research explores the application of repeated trust games from game theory to understand and model trust dynamics between agents, humans, and hybrid systems within computational governance frameworks.

## Trust Game Fundamentals

In classical game theory, trust games model strategic interactions where actors must decide whether to trust and cooperate with each other. When these games are repeated:

- Actors develop reputational histories
- Strategy evolution becomes possible
- Long-term cooperation can emerge as a stable equilibrium
- Punishment mechanisms for defection can be implemented

## Application to ChaosChain

The study of repeated trust games provides crucial insights for ChaosChain's governance model:

- Modeling trust dynamics between different agent implementations
- Understanding cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems
- Designing incentive structures that promote stable governance
- Analyzing the impact of transparent, verifiable histories on trust

## Research Focus Areas

### Agent-Agent Interactions

- Emergence of cooperative norms in agent communities
- Role of commitment mechanisms in trust building

### Human-Agent Interactions

- Asymmetric information and verification capabilities
- Trust building between humans and agent systems
- Impact of agent transparency on human trust decisions
- Cross-domain reputation systems

## Open Questions

- How do perfect memory and verification capabilities alter classical trust game equilibria?
- Can repeated trust games with verifiable agents achieve more efficient equilibria than human-only systems?
- What role does the transparency of agent decision-making play in trust game outcomes?
- How can reputation systems be designed to optimize for long-term cooperation?
