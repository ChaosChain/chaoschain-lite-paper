> **Warning:** This research section is currently in progress and under active development.

## Overview

As governance becomes increasingly compute-driven, novel security challenges emerge. This research examines the security implications of compute-maximized governance systems, focusing on threats, vulnerabilities, and defense mechanisms.

## Key Research Areas

- Core development team attack vectors
- Consensus system vulnerabilities in compute-intensive environments
- AI cognitive system attacks including prompt injection and data poisoning
- Governance capture through computational superiority

## Defense Mechanisms

Our research includes developing novel defensive strategies against computational governance attacks and establishing security modeling approaches specific to this domain.

*More detailed research findings will be published in this section as they become available.*
