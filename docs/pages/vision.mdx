# Vision and Mission

## Vision
Blockchains are evolving into fundamental coordination layers for autonomous systems, serving as transaction facilitators and resource registries. These systems will increasingly be designed, modified, and optimized by agents to meet specific coordination requirements across varying time horizons.

## Mission
Wei advances the integration of agents into blockchain protocol development and governance. We develop interfaces and frameworks that enable AI systems to participate as core developers, validators, and governance participants within the Ethereum ecosystem.

The future of Ethereum and the L2 ecosystem hinges on developing autonomous core developer agents. Integrating agents deeply within protocol governance could accelerate the Ethereum roadmap, allowing us to deliver unprecedented speed on scaling, security, and user experience.

Our mission at Wei is to realise this agentic future, by developing the interfaces, frameworks, and agents that will unlock the potential of agents for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## The Evolution of Ethereum Governance

### Current State: Human-Driven Governance
Currently, Ethereum and L2 governance and protocol development are primarily human-driven processes. Core developers, foundation members, and community stakeholders make technical and governance decisions through:
- EIP and specification process
- Governance forums and channels  
- Core developer calls
- Community feedback

### The start of the AI Shift
We're already witnessing a shift toward AI-assisted decision-making:
- Core developers leverage AI for development and evaluating proposals
- Community members use AI to understand the implications of protocol changes

### Wei's Role
Wei will accelerate this transition by:
- Developing specialized agents for protocol development
- Integrating agents into the governance process
- Researching and building systems for AI-human collaboration
- Improving access to and analysis of protocol information for Agents

### The Future: AI-Coordinated Systems
As this evolution progresses, we envision:
- AI systems coordinating entire protocol ecosystems
- Wei-developed chains as pioneers in agent-driven governance
- Seamless collaboration between human and AI core developers
- Enhanced protocol development through AI capabilities

## North Star
Our ultimate goal is to build agents capable of bootstrapping the next version of Ethereum, working in harmony with the current community. This involves:

### Technical Excellence
- Deep understanding of Ethereum protocols
- Advanced protocol design capabilities
- Technical expertise in security, performance, infrastructure, and more

### Community Integration
- Effective human-AI collaboration, integrating agents into the current channels
- Stakeholder engagement through proactive agents, actively and tastefully pinging members
- Human-centric value alignment
- Building trust of the current community in agentic systems

### Governance Evolution
- Accelerated delivery of Ethereum forks
- Faster resolution time on EIP discussion
- Transparent and auditable protocol development
- Community-centric approach

## Path Forward
The transition to agent-driven protocol development requires:
- Development of specialized AI capabilities
- Integration with existing governance structures
- Building trust through demonstrated competence
- Gradual expansion of agent responsibilities
- Continuous alignment with community values
