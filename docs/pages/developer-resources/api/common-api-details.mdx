# Common API Details

This page documents the common details shared across all ChaosChain REST APIs, including connection details, authentication, and response formats.

## Connection Details

All ChaosChain APIs are served over HTTPS on port 8443 by default. Each API has its own base path prefix:

```
https://localhost:8443/api/v1/[api-name]
```

Configuration options:

```bash
# Default port
8443

# Override with environment variable
export CHAOSCHAIN_API_PORT=9000

# Default bind address
127.0.0.1

# Override with environment variable
export CHAOSCHAIN_API_BIND=0.0.0.0
```

## Authentication

ChaosChain APIs use API keys for authentication. API keys are provided in the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

API keys can be generated and managed through the administrative interface. Each client should use its own API key, which can be rotated or revoked as needed.

## Common Response Format

All API responses follow a standard format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "req-123456789"
}
```

On error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": { /* optional additional error details */ }
  },
  "requestId": "req-123456789"
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

The APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 OK | Request was successful |
| 201 Created | Resource was successfully created |
| 400 Bad Request | The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters |
| 401 Unauthorized | Authentication failed or token is missing |
| 403 Forbidden | The client does not have permission to access the requested resource |
| 404 Not Found | The requested resource was not found |
| 409 Conflict | The request conflicts with the current state of the server |
| 429 Too Many Requests | The client has sent too many requests in a given time period |
| 500 Internal Server Error | An error occurred on the server |

## Content Types

All requests and responses use JSON format with the `application/json` content type. Binary data (like cryptographic keys and hashes) is represented as hex strings with the `0x` prefix or as base64-encoded strings, depending on the specific API endpoint.
